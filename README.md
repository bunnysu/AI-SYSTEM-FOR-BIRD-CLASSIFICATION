This project presents an AI-based bird classification
 system that uses TensorFlow and the EfficientNetB0
 model to accurately identify bird species from
 images. The model has been trained on images of
 525 different bird species, making it capable of
 recognizing multiple species with high accuracy.
 Upon receiving an input image, the AI analyzes the
 features and returns a list of possible bird species,
 ranked by the percentage of likelihood. The species
 with the highest percentage is highlighted, and a
 brief description of that bird is provided.
